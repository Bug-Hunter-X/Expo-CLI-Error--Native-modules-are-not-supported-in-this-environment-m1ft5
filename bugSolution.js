The bug.js file will contain code attempting to use a library with native dependencies.  We won't include the actual problematic code, as specific libraries will vary.   Instead, we focus on the solution in bugSolution.js.

bugSolution.js will showcase replacing the problematic library with an Expo-compatible one or a pure JavaScript equivalent:

```javascript
// bug.js (Illustrative - contains code using a library with native modules)
// ... code using a library causing the error ...

// bugSolution.js (Solution)
// Example: Replacing a problematic library (react-native-camera) with expo-camera
import * as Camera from 'expo-camera';

async function takePhoto() {
  const { status } = await Camera.requestCameraPermissionsAsync();
  if (status === 'granted') {
    // Take the photo
  } else {
    console.error('Camera permission not granted');
  }
}

//Use expo-image-picker for image selection instead of libraries with native dependencies.
// ... rest of the application code ...
```

The key is to choose libraries explicitly designed for Expo's managed workflow to prevent this error.
